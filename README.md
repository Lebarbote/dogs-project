Dogs Project.

This project is a social network, initially for dogs.

You will see the Feed of Photos already posted. If you want to create your own feed, you can register, log in and create a new password if you have forgotten the previous one.

In 'My Account' you will see your own feed of photos, being able to open them in a modal, make comments and see how many views this photo has.

You can navigate between the functions 'My Account', 'Statistics' and 'Post your Photo'.
